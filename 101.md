# Javascript 101 concerns

## Variables

1. JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

    - Automatically
    - Using `var`: for old browser support
    - Using `let`: for non-constant data
    - Using `const`: for constant data
    > It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
    > It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
    > You cannot re-declare a variable declared with `let` or `const`

2. If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.

    ```js
    let x;
    x = '5' + 2 + 3;
    // x = '523'
    x = 2 + 3 + '5'
    // x = '55'
    ```

3. For constant array, you can change only values inside it.

## Operators

1. `===` use to verify equal value with equal type and `!===` same as not equal with type

2. `>>>` unsigned right shift

3. `??=`; The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.

    ```js
    let x, y;
    x = null;
    y = 6;
    x ??= y;
    // x = 6
    ```

## Data Types

1. JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
    - String
    - Number
    - Bigint
    - Boolean
    - Undefined
    - Null
    - Symbol
    - Object
2. A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data. Also JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.

    ```js
    let x;
    x = 16 + 4 + 'volvo';
    // x = '20volvo'
    x = 'volvo' + 16 + 4;
    // x = 'volvo164'
    ```

3. Data types are dynamic.

    ```js
    let x;
    x = 5; // number
    x = 'john' // string
    ```

4. Javascript numbers are always one type; **double (64-bit floating point)**.

5. `undefined` and `null` are not same. undefined means value and data type both are unknown whereas null means only value is null.

    ```js
    let x; // undefined;
    typeof x // undefined
    x = null; // here `x` is object type and value is null
    typeof x // object
    ```

## Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```js
function name(params1, params2, params3) {
    // code to be executed
    // return something
}
```

1. You can call the function with incorrect parameters that may lead an unwanted answer.

    ```js
    function TwoSum(a, b) {
        return a+b;
    }

    let sum = TwoSum(10);
    // sum = NaN 
    sum = TwoSum('a')
    // sum = 'aundefined'
    ```

## Objects

How to Define a JavaScript Object:

- Using an Object Literal

    ```js
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
    // person is an object
    ```

    ```js
    const person = {}
    // empty object
    ```

- Using the new Keyword

    ```js
    // create empty object
    const person = new Object();

    // Add Properties
    person.firstName = "John";
    person.lastName = "Doe";
    person.age = 50;
    person.eyeColor = "blue";
    ```

- Using an Object Constructor

> For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.

## Primitives

> A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

    3.14 is a primitive value

> A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value. JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined
    symbol
    bigint

> Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

## Objects Properties

An Object is an Unordered Collection of Properties. Properties are the most important part of JavaScript objects. Properties can be changed, added, deleted, and some are read only.

1. `delete` to delete a property from an object

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: 'Shakil',
        age: 30
    }

    delete person.age;
    ```

    > The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.

## Arrays

An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.
Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:

- Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.
- Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.
- Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
- Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
- Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).

> It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.
